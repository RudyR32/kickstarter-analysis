Preforming analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Challenge
US Kickstarter campaigns for plays have the highest success rate when they have the lowest funding goals.  The success rate of US plays with a goal of less than $5000 was 73.5% which is higher than any other subset of the data.  There was an uptick between $35000 and $45000 (67% success rate) however, with only 9 plays falling in that category I would not consider that increased success rate statistically significant.  This theory is also supported by noting that both the mean and median goal for funding of successful plays are both lower than those of failed plays.  The highest number of Kickstarter campaigns for Theater projects are initiated in the second quarter of the year.  The second quarter of the year is also the period where Theater Kickstarter enjoy the highest success rates, May and June are the only months where success rates double those of failure rates.  The end of the year appears to be the worst period to launch a theater Kickstarter campaign as success rates begin to converge with failure rates, which does not hold true during any other point in the year.  One possible explanation for this is that May and June follow tax season; donors may be experiencing higher fiscal flexibility.  Conversely, at the end of the year donors may be experiencing other expenses related to holidays that affect their willingness to donate.  To relate this back to the module, if I was going to make a recommendation to Louise it would be to lower her monetary goal of $12000 and to start her campaign in May.
